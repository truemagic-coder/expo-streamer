```javascript
try {
    const recording = await ExpoPlayAudioStream.stopRecording();
    console.log("Recording stopped:", recording);

    // Play the recorded audio with specific encoding format
    const turnId = "example-turn-1";
    await ExpoPlayAudioStream.playAudio(
      base64Content,
      turnId,
      EncodingTypes.PCM_S16LE
    );

    // Clean up
    subscription?.remove();
  }, 5000);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Audio handling error:", error);
}

// You can also subscribe to audio events from anywhere
const audioSubscription = ExpoPlayAudioStream.subscribeToAudioEvents(
  async (event) => {
    console.log("Audio event received:", {
      data: event.data,
      soundLevel: event.soundLevel, // Sound level can be used for visualization or voice detection
    });
  }
);
// Don't forget to clean up when done
// audioSubscription.remove();
```

### Simultaneous Recording and Playback

These methods are designed for scenarios where you need to record and play audio at the same time:

```javascript
import {
  ExpoPlayAudioStream,
  EncodingTypes,
  PlaybackModes,
} from "expo-audio-stream";

// Example of simultaneous recording and playback with voice processing
async function handleSimultaneousRecordAndPlay() {
  try {
    // Configure sound playback with optimized voice processing settings
    await ExpoPlayAudioStream.setSoundConfig({
      sampleRate: 44100,
      playbackMode: PlaybackModes.VOICE_PROCESSING,
    });

    // Start microphone with voice processing
    const { recordingResult, subscription } =
      await ExpoPlayAudioStream.startMicrophone({
        enableProcessing: true,
        onAudioStream: (event) => {
          console.log("Received audio stream with voice processing:", {
            audioDataBase64: event.data,
            soundLevel: event.soundLevel,
          });
        },
      });

    // Play audio while recording is active, with specific encoding format
    const turnId = "response-turn-1";
    await ExpoPlayAudioStream.playSound(
      someAudioBase64,
      turnId,
      EncodingTypes.PCM_F32LE
    );

    // Play a complete WAV file directly
    await ExpoPlayAudioStream.playWav(wavBase64Data);

    // Example of controlling playback during recording
    setTimeout(async () => {
      // Clear the queue for a specific turn
      await ExpoPlayAudioStream.clearSoundQueueByTurnId(turnId);

      // Interrupt current playback
      await ExpoPlayAudioStream.interruptSound();

      // Resume playback
      await ExpoPlayAudioStream.resumeSound();

      // Stop microphone recording
      await ExpoPlayAudioStream.stopMicrophone();

      // Clean up
      subscription?.remove();
    }, 5000);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Simultaneous audio handling error:", error);
  }
}
```

## API üìö

The Expo Play Audio Stream module provides the following methods:

### Standard Audio Operations

- `destroy()`: Destroys the audio stream module, cleaning up all resources. This should be called when the module is no longer needed. It will reset all internal state and release audio resources.

- `startRecording(recordingConfig: RecordingConfig)`: Starts microphone recording with the specified configuration. Returns a promise with recording result and audio event subscription. Throws an error if the recording fails to start.

- `stopRecording()`: Stops the current microphone recording. Returns a promise that resolves to the audio recording data. Throws an error if the recording fails to stop.

- `playAudio(base64Chunk: string, turnId: string, encoding?: Encoding)`: Plays a base64 encoded audio chunk with the specified turn ID. The optional encoding parameter allows specifying the format of the audio data ('pcm_f32le' or 'pcm_s16le', defaults to 'pcm_s16le'). Throws an error if the audio chunk fails to stream.

- `pauseAudio()`: Pauses the current audio playback. Throws an error if the audio playback fails to pause.

- `stopAudio()`: Stops the currently playing audio. Throws an error if the audio fails to stop.

- `clearPlaybackQueueByTurnId(turnId: string)`: Clears the playback queue for a specific turn ID. Throws an error if the playback queue fails to clear.

- `setSoundConfig(config: SoundConfig)`: Sets the sound player configuration with options for sample rate and playback mode. The SoundConfig interface accepts:

  - `sampleRate`: The sample rate for audio playback in Hz (16000, 44100, or 48000)
  - `playbackMode`: The playback mode ('regular', 'voiceProcessing', or 'conversation')
  - `useDefault`: When true, resets to default configuration regardless of other parameters

  Default settings are:

  - Android: sampleRate: 44100, playbackMode: 'regular'
  - iOS: sampleRate: 44100.0, playbackMode: 'regular'

### Simultaneous Recording and Playback

These methods are specifically designed for scenarios where you need to record and play audio at the same time:

- `startMicrophone(recordingConfig: RecordingConfig)`: Starts microphone streaming with voice processing enabled. Returns a promise that resolves to an object containing the recording result and a subscription to audio events. Throws an error if the recording fails to start.

- `stopMicrophone()`: Stops the current microphone streaming. Returns a promise that resolves to the audio recording data or null. Throws an error if the microphone streaming fails to stop.

- `playSound(audio: string, turnId: string, encoding?: Encoding)`: Plays a sound while recording is active. Uses voice processing to prevent feedback. The optional encoding parameter allows specifying the format of the audio data ('pcm_f32le' or 'pcm_s16le', defaults to 'pcm_s16le'). Throws an error if the sound fails to play.

- `stopSound()`: Stops the currently playing sound in simultaneous mode. Throws an error if the sound fails to stop.

- `interruptSound()`: Interrupts the current sound playback in simultaneous mode. Throws an error if the sound fails to interrupt.

- `resumeSound()`: Resumes the current sound playback in simultaneous mode. Throws an error if the sound fails to resume.

- `clearSoundQueueByTurnId(turnId: string)`: Clears the sound queue for a specific turn ID in simultaneous mode. Throws an error if the sound queue fails to clear.

- `playWav(wavBase64: string)`: Plays a WAV format audio file from base64 encoded data. Unlike playSound(), this method plays the audio directly without queueing. The audio data should be base64 encoded WAV format. Throws an error if the WAV audio fails to play.

- `toggleSilence()`: Toggles the silence state of the microphone during recording. This can be useful for temporarily muting the microphone without stopping the recording session. Throws an error if the microphone fails to toggle silence.

- `promptMicrophoneModes()`: Prompts the user to select the microphone mode (iOS specific feature).

### Buffered Audio Streaming

These methods enable jitter-buffered playback with health monitoring and adaptive behavior:

- `startBufferedAudioStream(config: BufferedStreamConfig)`: Starts a buffered audio stream for the given turn ID. Initializes an internal buffer manager, optionally sets encoding, begins playback, and (optionally) starts periodic health reporting via `onBufferHealth`.

- `playAudioBuffered(base64Chunk: string, turnId: string, isFirst?: boolean, isFinal?: boolean)`: Enqueues a base64-encoded audio chunk for buffered playback for the specified turn. Use `isFirst`/`isFinal` to mark boundaries.

- `stopBufferedAudioStream(turnId: string)`: Stops buffered playback for the given turn ID, destroys internal resources, and clears the native queue for that turn.

- `getBufferHealthMetrics(turnId: string): IBufferHealthMetrics | null`: Returns the current buffer health metrics for a turn if available, otherwise `null`.

- `isBufferedAudioStreamPlaying(turnId: string): boolean`: Returns whether the buffered stream for the given turn ID is actively playing.

- `updateBufferedAudioConfig(turnId: string, config: Partial<IAudioBufferConfig>)`: Updates buffer configuration on the fly and applies adaptive adjustments.

### Event Subscriptions

- `subscribeToAudioEvents(onMicrophoneStream: (event: AudioDataEvent) => Promise<void>)`: Subscribes to audio events emitted during recording/streaming. The callback receives an AudioDataEvent containing:

  - `data`: Base64 encoded audio data at original sample rate
  - `position`: Current position in the audio stream
  - `fileUri`: URI of the recording file
  - `eventDataSize`: Size of the current audio data chunk
  - `totalSize`: Total size of recorded audio so far
  - `soundLevel`: Optional sound level measurement that can be used for visualization
    Returns a subscription that should be cleaned up when no longer needed.

- `subscribeToSoundChunkPlayed(onSoundChunkPlayed: (event: SoundChunkPlayedEventPayload) => Promise<void>)`: Subscribes to events emitted when a sound chunk has finished playing. The callback receives a payload indicating if this was the final chunk. Returns a subscription that should be cleaned up when no longer needed.

### Health Monitoring
```javascript
// Check system health
const health = await ExpoPlayAudioStream.getHealthStatus();
console.log('System Health:', {
  recorderStatus: health.recorderStatus,
  playbackStatus: health.playbackStatus,
  memoryUsage: health.memoryUsage,
  threadSafety: health.threadSafety
});
```

### Debug Mode
```javascript
// Enable comprehensive logging
ExpoPlayAudioStream.setDebugMode(true);
```

- `subscribe<T>(eventName: string, onEvent: (event: T | undefined) => Promise<void>)`: Generic subscription method for any event emitted by the module. Available events include:
  - `AudioData`: Emitted when new audio data is available during recording
  - `SoundChunkPlayed`: Emitted when a sound chunk finishes playing
  - `SoundStarted`: Emitted when sound playback begins

Note: When playing audio, you can use the special turnId `"supspend-sound-events"` to suppress sound events for that particular playback. This is useful when you want to play audio without triggering the sound events.

### Types

- `Encoding`: Defines the audio encoding format, either 'pcm_f32le' (32-bit float) or 'pcm_s16le' (16-bit signed integer)
- `EncodingTypes`: Constants for audio encoding formats (EncodingTypes.PCM_F32LE, EncodingTypes.PCM_S16LE)
- `PlaybackMode`: Defines different playback modes ('regular', 'voiceProcessing', or 'conversation')
- `PlaybackModes`: Constants for playback modes (PlaybackModes.REGULAR, PlaybackModes.VOICE_PROCESSING, PlaybackModes.CONVERSATION)
- `SampleRate`: Supported sample rates (16000, 44100, or 48000 Hz)
- `RecordingEncodingType`: Encoding type for recording ('pcm_32bit', 'pcm_16bit', or 'pcm_8bit')

- `AudioEvents`: Enumeration of event names emitted by the module.
- `DeviceReconnectedReason`: Enumeration of reasons for device reconnection events.
- `DeviceReconnectedEventPayload`: Payload type for device reconnection events.
- `SuspendSoundEventTurnId`: Constant turn ID that suppresses sound events for a specific playback.

- `IAudioBufferConfig`: Configuration for the jitter buffer (sizes, thresholds, timing).
- `IAudioPlayPayload`: Structured payload used when enqueuing buffered audio frames.
- `IAudioFrame`: Individual audio frame representation used by buffering internals.
- `BufferHealthState`: Health state classification for the jitter buffer.
- `IBufferHealthMetrics`: Health metrics snapshot of the buffer (levels, underruns, etc.).
- `IAudioBufferManager`: Interface for buffer manager implementations.
- `BufferedStreamConfig`: Configuration for starting buffered audio streams.
- `SmartBufferConfig`: Configuration for adaptive buffer behavior.
- `SmartBufferMode`: Modes for adaptive buffering strategies.
- `NetworkConditions`: Network conditions used to guide adaptive buffering.

Advanced exports (for low-level/advanced usage):

- `AudioBufferManager`, `SmartBufferManager`: Buffer manager implementations.
- `FrameProcessor`, `QualityMonitor`: Processing and quality monitoring utilities.

All methods are static and most return Promises that resolve when the operation is complete. Comprehensive error handling is built into each method with descriptive error messages and proper Result types.
